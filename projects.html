				<h2>Personal-Website</h2>
				<h4>Fall 2024</h4>
				<p>This project is the website you are currently visiting. I am using concepts from my Client-Side Web Development Class to create a portfolio of my programming work.</p>

				<h2>BowlingScoring</h2>
				<h4>Fall 2024</h4>
				<p>This was my first project where I took on object-oriented programming outside of a class. It is a simple scoring program for a game of bowling with ASCII visuals. </p>
			</div>
			<div class = "alternate">
				<h2>Data Structures</h2>
				<h4>Summer 2024</h4>
				<p>This project is unique because it was the only one that was partly required as part of a course. Each of the data structures were coded during the course, but the menuing and input file generation was completely done by myself. This was also my first time implementing a settings menu for a program.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>BaseN</h2>
				<h4>Spring 2024</h4>
				<p>This was my first larger-scale project with more complex menuing. It allows for the user to go through four concepts that I learned in my discrete math class. I was not required to make this program, but I thought it would be fun to emulate the by-hand methods in a program. There are many shortcuts I could have taken in the implementation of the concepts, but I chose to stick as closely as possible to the paper methods.</p>
			</div>
			<div class = "alternate">
				<h2>SigFigs</h2>
				<h4>Spring 2024</h4>
				<p>This project was created during my Chemistry 101 class. It calculates the amount of significant figures that are in a user-entered value. I chose to do this project to break down how significant figures work because I would have to become very familiar with the concept during the chemistry class.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>TimeTillNextClass</h2>
				<h4>Fall 2023</h4>
				<p>This project was my first side-project outside of my coursework that I used to help learn the concepts of my first programming class. There are examples of almost every fundamental concept of coding in this program. It is a simple time calculator that takes in user input of what time a class is, the current time, and the time it takes to get to the class. The program then outputs how much time the user has before they must leave for class, or that the user is late to class.</p>
